												<h3>Unit-1: Introduction to Cyber Security</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This week will focus on the drivers of computer-based information namely: types of networks, types of software, and databases; the internet and the World Wide Web and how it works. It discusses the various functions of these components in an information system and the impact of this on the system in the event of a security breach. It begins by examining the considerable shift in paradigm from manual to digital approaches to processing and storing of data, and how this has consequently given rise to cybercrime and the impact of this on organisations and draws on the key concepts of CIA in Cyber Security, which serves as a background to the module.

										</header>
										<p>This unit focuses on approaches to designing Cyber Security solutions. There are various methods and techniques available to develop security solutions. To be able to design effective solutions, it is important to be able to effectively identify the threats and vulnerabilities which will inform the best solution to adopt. We will be exploring these principles that underpin good security designs.

										</header>
										<p>This week, the focus is on the implementation of security solutions. The lecturecast will introduce object-oriented approaches to secure software design solutions using UML diagrams within the context of Cyber Security. An introduction to programming will also be covered. This includes the application of UML object-oriented modelling techniques, such as use case and sequence diagrams, to develop a design document required for project implementation. The introduction to programming will cover the principles of programming, as well as the implementation of these principles using the Python programming language.
