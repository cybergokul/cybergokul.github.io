<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
<p>You will have selected the topic for this task from the list provided in Unit 1. You should refer to the Guide Questions provided in Unit 2 to evaluate and refine your literature review before submission, bearing in mind the key aims of a standalone literature review (with the applicable grading criterion highlighted from the grid on the Module Resources page):</p>
<ul>
    <li>To provide an overview of current knowledge on the chosen topic.</li>
    <li>To demonstrate an awareness of relevant, current literature.</li>
    <li>To highlight similar and contrasting views on your chosen topic.</li>
    <li>To showcase your research and writing skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Proposal Presentation</h2>
<h3>Assignment Brief</h3>
<p>The research proposal presentation fulfils the learning outcomes where you will evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for your chosen topic, including data analysis processes and so produce and evaluate critically a research proposal for your chosen topic. This can be based on the literature review topic you chose in Unit 1 or the topic of your capstone project for MSc Students (MSc students - Please see the BCS Project Requirements document on the Module Resources page and also the CyBOK Knowledge Base for those taking on Cyber Security Projects as your Cyber Security project should fall into one of these CyBOK Knowledge Areas, as well as meeting BCS requirements).</p>
